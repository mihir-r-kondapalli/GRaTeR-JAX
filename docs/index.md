**GRaTeR-JAX** is a Python library for forward modeling of scattered-light images of circumstellar debris disks.
It builds upon the *Generalized Radial Transporter (GRaTeR)* framework [(Augereau+ 1999)](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9906429) using the **JAX** ecosystem to achieve fast, differentiable, GPU-accelerated computation for disk simulations, parameter inference, and image optimization.

Developed by the **UCSB Exoplanet Polarimetry Lab**, GRaTeR-JAX provides the foundation for analyzing debris disks using modern differentiable programming techniques.

## Features
* **GPU/TPU acceleration** through JAX
* **Differentiable physical modeling** for analytical gradient-based optimization
* **Spline SPF Modeling** for more dynamic and accurate scattering phase function (SPF) fitting
* **PSF convolution** for both static and dynamic PSFs, such as those from _JWST_
* **Modular design** for more flexibility and control
* **Higher Level API** for more intuitive and user-friendly disk fitting
* **Image Processing Utilities** for ingesting data, making PSF models, and estimating noise
